# About this module:
This module was created for the **Griffith Ecology Lab**, a research group based at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. The module has been designed to document the evolution of behaviour, physiology, and life-history variation across bird species in the rural New South Wales, Australia. Specifically the module monitors the physical condition of individual birds and it evolution over time.

## Authorship
This module was co-developed by Simon C. Griffith at Macquarie University and Adela Sobotkova and Petra Janouchova at the FAIMS Project, Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University.

## Funding:
Development of this module was funded by MQ Strategic Infrastructure Scheme 20110089 for FAIMS development in 2016 and the **Research Attraction and Acceleration Program (RAAP)** aimed to support innovation and investment in the New South Wales in 2016 and 2017.
